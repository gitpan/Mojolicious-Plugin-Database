NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Database - "proper" handling of DBI based
    connections in Mojolicious

VERSION
    version 1.06

SYNOPSIS
    Provides "sane" handling of DBI connections so problems with pre-forking
    (Hypnotoad, etc.) will not occur.

        use Mojolicious::Plugin::Database;

        sub startup {
            my $self = shift;

            $self->plugin('database', { 
                dsn      => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=foo',
                username => 'myusername',
                password => 'mypassword',
                options  => { 'pg_enable_utf8' => 1, AutoCommit => 0 },
                helper   => 'db',
                });
        }

CONFIGURATION
    The only required option is the 'dsn' one, which should contain a valid
    DBI dsn to connect to your database of choice.

METHODS/HELPERS
    A helper is created with a name you specified (or 'db' by default) that
    can be used to get the active DBI connection.
