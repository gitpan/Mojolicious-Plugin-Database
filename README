NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::Database - "proper" handling of DBI based
    connections in Mojolicious

VERSION
    version 1.08

SYNOPSIS
    Provides "sane" handling of DBI connections so problems with pre-forking
    (Hypnotoad, etc.) will not occur.

        use Mojolicious::Plugin::Database;

        sub startup {
            my $self = shift;

            $self->plugin('database', { 
                dsn      => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=foo',
                username => 'myusername',
                password => 'mypassword',
                options  => { 'pg_enable_utf8' => 1, AutoCommit => 0 },
                helper   => 'db',
                });

            # or if you require multiple databases at the same time
            $self->plugin('database', { 
                databases => {
                    'db1' => { 
                        dsn      => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=foo',
                        username => 'myusername',
                        password => 'mypassword',
                    },
                    'db2' => {
                        dsn      => 'dbi:MySQL:dbname=bar',
                        username => 'othername',
                        password => 'otherpassword',
                    },
                },
            });
        }

CONFIGURATION
  CONNECTING TO A SINGLE DATABASE
    When connecting to a single database, the following configuration
    options are recognised:

    'dsn' should contain the DSN string required by DBI
    'username' the username that should be used to authenticate
    'password' the password that should be used to authenticate
    'options' options to pass to the DBD driver
    'helper' the name of the helper to associate with this database
    (default: db)

    The only required option is 'dsn', every other option is optional.

  CONNECTING TO MULTIPLE DATABASES
    When you have the need to connect to multiple databases (or different
    RDBMS types), the following options are recognised:

    'databases' A hash reference whose key is the helper name, and the value
    is another hash reference containing connection options.

METHODS/HELPERS
    A helper is created with a name you specified (or 'db' by default) that
    can be used to get the active DBI connection. When using multiple
    databases, you also get multiple helpers.

    Based on a small example by sri and his request if someone could please
    write a plugin for this stuff.

    Babatope Aloba for pointing out it'd be really useful to be able to
    connect to multiple databases at once.
